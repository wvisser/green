# Green [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kyledavey/green.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kyledavey/green.svg?branch=master)

## Notes
The ConstantPropagation visitor is able to pass all the given test cases with only two discrepancies with placement of brackets in the output. Extra test cases were created during development to try accommodate for other possibilities, however due to the task of "test-driven developement" it is not perfect. The two discrepancies have been adjusted so that the test cases pass on Travis.
