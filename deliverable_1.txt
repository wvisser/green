The problem was a missing "=" character in the test oracle.

This was found by adding a formatter to the JUnit target in build.xml to print
detailed output (including failing tests with their expected values) to the
terminal (thank you StackOverflow).

While searching I did discover that JUnit was already actually printing the
desired output to a file somewhere in /bin, but I left my changes as is because
printing errors to the terminal is nice as well.
