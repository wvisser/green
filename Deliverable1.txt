Deliverable 1:

My first thought process was to read the readme provided. When added to the knowledge you gave us verbally I decided to look into .travis.yml file to see how travis was building the repo.

There I stumbled upon ant test. I googled “ant test commands” in the hope of finding a cool way to print out errors and found the following URL: https://ant.apache.org/manual/Tasks/junit.html

After reading the website I realized that these commands are not actually used in travis.yml but somewhere else. That place turned out to be build.xml after piecing together what you and the readme suggested.

Next, following the comments to the “test” part of the code, I tried multiple methods and eventually one worked. I used <formatter type="plain" usefile="false"/> to print out the error messages as well as the test cases in a nice format.
