In Test 20, line 305,
check(o3, "(2<=2)&&(aa<2)", "1*v+-1<0");
was replaced with 
check(o3, "(2<=2)&&(aa<2)", "1*v+-1<=0");
which makes the expression evaluate correctly.

I added a formatter (see code below) to the build.xml file, in the TARGET:test. This enables a report to be printed to the screen, basically prints a logfile of exactly what is happening. 

<formatter type="plain" usefile="false" />

The log file print out the following regarding the failed testcase:

[junit] 	FAILED
    [junit] expected:<[1*v+-1<0]> but was:<[1*v+-1<=0]>
    [junit] junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: expected:<[1*v+-1<0]> but was:<[1*v+-1<=0]>
    [junit] 	at za.ac.sun.cs.green.service.canonizer.SATCanonizerTest.finalCheck(SATCanonizerTest.java:43)
    [junit] 	at za.ac.sun.cs.green.service.canonizer.SATCanonizerTest.check(SATCanonizerTest.java:56)
    [junit] 	at za.ac.sun.cs.green.service.canonizer.SATCanonizerTest.test20(SATCanonizerTest.java:307)


It is clear the assertion failed.
So I changed it to match what the system required.
