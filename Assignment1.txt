Task1:

    Inserted the following line into the build.xml in the junit file to display the junit report file.
        <formatter type="plain" usefile="false" />
    This showed the error in the expected value of test20, which was fixed by replacing the following line of code:
        check(o3, "(2<=2)&&(aa<2)", "1*v+-1<0");
    with
        check(o3, "(2<=2)&&(aa<2)", "1*v+-1<=0");
