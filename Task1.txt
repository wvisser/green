Task 1
I started off by uncommenting the testcase in SATCanonizerTest.java that fails. I then went into the build.xml file. In there, in the test target I changed haltonfailure from "yes" to "no". 
After running the program again I saw that in bin/junit/TEST-za.ac.sun.cs.green.EntireSuit.xml an error had been added showing the expected result compared to the actual result, the difference being a < instead of a <=. I then changed the expected result to fix the error and now the testcase doesn't fail anymore.

For Task 2, the failing test details required can be found in bin/junit/TEST-za.ac.sun.cs.green.EntireSuit.xml .
