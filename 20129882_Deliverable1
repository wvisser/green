Began by modifying build.xml where I changed on line 98, the haltonfailure="yes" to haltonfailure="no", as this allowed for the build to continue even after a test case failure.

This then resulted in the error being output into a file TESTS-TestSuites.xml (As could be seen from the previously crude output) where it was clear what the error was in test case 20.

As a result, the Oracle for test case 20 was changed to <=0 rather than <0.
